# MCDropout and MCDropConnect

A practical implementation of MCDropout and MCDropconnect for regression and classification to display the ways in which dropout can be repurposed to quantify uncertainty for neural networks. The implementation is based on papers referenced below. MCDropout_AmpudiaLeung.ipynb is the final notebook to display our implementation. Work was completed in collaboration with David Ampudia.
